#####################
This deeplearning module will soon be deprecated - please consider using the default python module instead!
It is accessible via "module load python/2.7-anaconda-4.4" (for python3 use python/3.6-anaconda-4.4
The Anaconda distribution contains all the deeplearning frameworks in this module (apart from Lasagne), fully integrated with all other python modules.
